# Installing Material UI

[docs][https://material-ui.com/#/]

We'll now change the header for an [`App Bar`][https://material-ui.com/components/app-bar/] component. Links from the header will be moved to the [`Nav Drawer`][https://material-ui.com/components/drawers/] component that we will import.

Note how we added a `theme.js` to keep consistency.

Note the import of [`clsx`][https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx] to help with material-ui's css modules implementations
